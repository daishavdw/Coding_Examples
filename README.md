# Coding_Examples
Examples of coding done in some of my CS classes and during my research.
-The XIC_Spectral_Tutorial is from research done in the Sam Payne Lab at BYU. This walks someone through how to draw an XIC or an Spectra.
-The Spelling Corrector file is written in Java. The code takes file of words and stores them in an object called a Trie. When a misspelled word is given, the program will make suggestions of potential correct words.
-The Fermat file implements the Fermat and Miller-Rabin tests.
-The Traveling Sales Person lab implements a greedy algorithm and a branch and bound algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem.
